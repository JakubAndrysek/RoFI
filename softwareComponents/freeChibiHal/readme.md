# Chibi OSAL for FreeRTOS

This small library allows us to use Chibi HAL with FreeRTOS on STM32 (and thus,
release our software under MIT licence).

The library is based on the work of:
- [Bertold Van den Bergh](https://github.com/BertoldVdb/FreeRTOS-ChibiOSAL)
- [Tercio Filho](https://github.com/0x3333/chibios_svn_mirror)
