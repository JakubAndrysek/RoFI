# Reconfiguration test cases

Each reconfiguration test case contains files `init.in` and `goal.in` defining initial 
and goal configuration respectively. It may also contain outputs from reconfiguration
and visualization program such as reconfiguration paths, images, camera settings and videos.

List and short description of test cases:

* `2-climb`: Two modules, where one is supposed to climb on the other.
* `3-attach`: Starting from a tower of three modules one is supposed to get attached on 
the side of the middle one.
